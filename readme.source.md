## NuGet package

https://nuget.org/packages/NServiceBus.Utf8Json/


## Usage

snippet: Utf8JsonSerialization


### Resolver

It is possible to customize the instance of [IJsonFormatterResolver](https://github.com/neuecc/Utf8Json#resolver) used for serialization.

snippet: Utf8JsonResolver


### Custom content key

When using [additional deserializers](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/serialization/#specifying-additional-deserializers) or transitioning between different versions of the same serializer it can be helpful to take explicit control over the content type a serializer passes to NServiceBus (to be used for the [ContentType header](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/headers#serialization-headers-nservicebus-contenttype)).

snippet: Utf8JsonContentTypeKey


## Currently not supported

The use of `DataBusProperty<T>` is not supported because the property doesn't provide a default constructor. However, the use of the [databus conventions](https://docs.particular.net/nservicebus/messaging/databus) is supported.
